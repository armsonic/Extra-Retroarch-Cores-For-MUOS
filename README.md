# Extra-Retroarch-Cores-For-MUOS
These are retroarch cores that have been recompiled in aarch64 and packaged into .muxzip files for you to install

# Information
These retroarch cores have been taken from the repository of christianhaitian so all the credit for the cores goes to him.
The link to his github page => https://github.com/christianhaitian
The link to his repository => https://github.com/christianhaitian/retroarch-cores
All I simply do is take one of his recomplied cores and create a assignment folder and file for it so that MUOS will reconize the core and add it to it's menu.
